\Abstract{The extended narrow-line region (ENLR) is a puzzling structure of highly ionized gas, with a typical conical or bi-conical shape, that can also be called ionization cones. 
The ENLR is often aligned with the radio jets of the host galaxy and the complex kinematics observed in some of them suggest a possible interaction between the gas and the jets. 
The unified model predicts the existence of this kind of structures only in type 2 AGN, because the ionizing radiation can escape the AGN only along the axis of the dusty torus, but it is observed also in some type 1 objects. 
Follow-up observations of a narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxy with a recently discovered extended radio emission, Mrk 783, showed an extended optical emission, aligned with the radio emission, with a probable AGN origin making Mrk 783 the first NLS1 with ionization cones. 
Understanding the properties and the origin of this structure in Mrk 783 would be fundamental to improve our general knowledge of ENLRs.}

\ScientificRationale{The extended narrow-line region (ENLR) is a poorly understood structure typical of active galactic nuclei (AGN). 
It is a region of highly ionized gas with a conical or bi-conical shape, which originates close to the nuclear region and with a size comparable with the dimension of the host galaxy ([18], [22]).
It is often aligned to the radio emission produced by the AGN (e.g. [22], [16]) and sometimes it shows complex line profiles ([16], [21], [6]) produced by outflows observed both in the cold and warm phase of the interstellar medium (ISM; [2],[15],[17],[9]).
This is usually considered a hint of interaction between the radio jets and the ISM in the ENLR ([23], [24], [19], [22], [4]), making it a natural laboratory to study the influence of the AGN in the life of the host galaxy, the so called  AGN feedback ([11]).

The presence of the ENLR was predicted by the unified model of AGN ([1]) as a consequence of a dusty torus surrounding the AGN and absorbing part of the incoming radiation.
Due to the shape of the torus the radiation can escape and ionize the gas only along its axis, producing the narrow-line region (NLR) and the ENLR.
These regions are characterized by spectra with narrow lines (FWHM $\sim 300$--$800$ \kms) from both permitted and forbidden transitions. 
The presence of forbidden lines indicates that the density of the ionized gas is relatively low ($\rm N_e \sim 10^3$--$10^4$ cm$^{-3}$).

The ENLR is observed only in an handful of objects ($\sim 50$ so far, [20]), typically type 2 AGN.
The small number of discovered structures is probably caused by a combination of biases of the observations (the development of new integral field spectrograph is bringing to the discovery and analysis of new structures, e.g. []) and of intrinsic properties of the AGN and of its host galaxy such as: the shape of the ionizing continuum, the gas distribution and the inclination of the AGN [18]. 
These last properties are also the reason why the ENLR is usually observed in type 2 sources.
However, there are some reported cases of intermediate Seyfert galaxies showing ionization cones (e.g. NGC 4151, [10]), suggesting that the models are still far to be accurate.

Mrk 783 is a narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy, a peculiar subclass of the traditional Seyfert 1 galaxies characterized by broad permitted lines (H$\beta$ in particular) with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) smaller than $2000$ km s$^{-1}$.
The object is particular interesting because of the presence of an extended radio emission with an extension of the order of $10$ kpc ([10], Fig. 1-A). 
It is one of the few object of this class with such an extended radio structure, and its properties are very peculiar and, even though it has been proven that the structure is related to the AGN, its nature is still unknown [10].

The interesting properties of this object are not limited to the radio band.
A spectroscopic follow-up with the LDSS3 spectrograph of the Magellan telescopes (Congiu et al. FRASS) revealed the presence of an ENLR, with an extraordinary size for an object of the nearby universe ($~ 35$ kpc), aligned with the axis of the extended radio emission (Fig. 1-A,B). 
On the other hand, archival SDSS images show extended structures similar to tidal tails at least on one side of the AGN, while close to the nucleus there seems to be a second, point-like, structure that might be the remaining of a galaxy that merged recently with our target (Fig. 1-C).

All these properties make Mrk 783 an extremely interesting object to study. 
The presence of both an ENLR and an extended radio emission makes Mrk 783 perfect to investigate the interaction between these two structures and therefore how the AGN influences its host galaxy.
The object is even more interesting because of the presence of the tidal tail and of the second point-like structure observed closed to the AGN, possible hints of a recent merging.
Merging are believed to be able to trigger the activity of active galaxies (e.g. []), therefore 

}


\ImmediateObjective{
We propose to observe the NLS1 galaxy Mrk 783 with MUSE, in order to investigate the following topics:

\textbf{1) Studying the morphology of the extended emission:}
Mrk 783 shows an ENLR with a unique extension, not only for a Type 1 AGN but also for AGN in general. 
Why is it so extended? Is there a relation between the size of the ENLR and the recent merging event that is suggested by several properties of the galaxy?
From MUSE data we will recover the morphology of the structure and spatially resolved kinematical information, allowing us to investigate the presence of structures with peculiar shapes and/or kinematics that can be produced during a merging;

\textbf{2) to study the physical properties of the gas;} 
The large number of emission line present in the observed wavelength range will allow us to build diagnostic diagrams (Baldwin+ 1981) to investigate the ionization source of the gas which is fundamental to characterize the ENLR but also the emission of the gas in the whole galaxy.
While photo-ionization from the AGN is usually the main ionization source in these structures, NLS1s are known to host a significant amount of star formation that can contribute to the ionization of the gas.
Star formation can also be responsible for part of the diffuse radio emission of this galaxy, therefore identify the star forming regions and estimating the star formation rate is fundamental to better understand the emission fo this object at all wavelengths;

\textbf{3) to investigate the relation between the optical and radio extended emission:}
In most AGN radio and optical extended emission are often observed together and with similar morphologies and orientations (e.g. Schmitt+03, Kharb+06), a hint of the interaction between the ISM of the AGN host galaxy and the jets produced by the AGN.
The spectra that have been analyzed already show the alignment of these two structures in Mrk 783, but a comparison between the morphology of the radio emission and of the ENLR, especially in the inner kiloparsecs, can confirm the relation between the two structures and also reveal the exact position where the interaction is taking, or took if the relic nature of the radio emission will be confirmed by future radio observations, place;

\textbf{4) to investigate the nature of the second point-like source:}
Among the peculiarities of Mrk 783, the point-like source observed close to the AGN is one of the most puzzling and interesting. 
While ground base observations with no adaptive optics cannot fully resolve the two structures, the comparison between the kinematics of the gas and the kinematic of the stellar component in the regions close to the nucleus, will be fundamental to understand if this point-like structure is actually part of the galaxy or if it is an external structure that was accreted during a merging episode.

The data were acquired with a total exposure time of $1$ hour, with a seeing of $0.8\arcsec$ and the slit oriented along the axis of the radio emission (PA $= 131\deg$). 
The spatial resolution is $0.189\arcsec$ px$^{-1}$ and the dispersion is $\sim 2$ \AA\,px$^{-1}$.
In the lower part of the spectrum it is possible to observe an extended emission, which can be traced up to $\sim27\arcsec$ ($\sim35$ kpc) from the galactic nucleus in all the three lines.
The optical emission is extended well beyond the radio emission, which is almost contained inside the host galaxy.

% All macros in this box are NOT checked at the pdfLaTeX compilation.

\WhyLunarPhase{The g -band magnitude of the source from SDSS is $17.4$ but the diffuse emission will be significantly lower,  as it is possible to see by the spectrum in Fig. C. Therefore observations in gray nights at least, are needed to provide data with the requested quality.}  

\WhyNights{We propose to observe the ENLR of Mrk 783.
We used the Optical AO Integral-Field Spectroscopy Mode Version P104 ETC to estimate the exposure time. 
According to the ETC, with $2$ hours of integration we would be able to detect the H$\beta$ line with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) $\sim5$ up to a surface brightness of $9\times10**{-17}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ arcsec$^{-2}$.
This sensitivity will allow us to detect and reliably measure H$\beta$ in each single spaxels in most of the extension of the ENLR.
In such a way we will be able to study the morphology of the ENLR also in the most extended parts without using any binning that could mask or smooth eventual structures.
This simulations were performed considering the ENLR as an uniformly distributed extended source, observed at airmass $1.5$ with a seeing at zenith of $0.8$ arcsec.
The relatively low seeing requirement is needed to compensate for the fact that the object can be observed at Paranal only at relatively high airmasses.
}

\TelescopeJustification{
While narrow-band imaging could help solve some of these points, in particular those regarding the morphology of the ENLR, the redshift of the galaxy (z $= 0.0672$) is high enough that the [O III]$\lambda5007$ emission line, the one that best trace the morphology of the ENLR, falls outside the range covered by narrow-band filters available in almost all the largest observatory.
Moreover the spectral information provided by a MUSE datacube are fundamental to fully characterize this interesting object.
Because of the large FOV covered with a single pointing, the spatial and spectral resolution and the large diameter of the telescope, the combination of MUSE and VLT is the best one to study ENLR.
Emission lines map produced with MUSE have the same, if not better, quality with respect to those acquired with the best ground based imagers 
Other available integral field spectrographs at other telescopes have unsuitable FOV to cover such an extended object (e.g. GMOS@Gemini) or they sacrifice spatial and spectral resolution (e.g. VIMOS@VLT)

 
Moreover, the instrument can observe a relatively wide spectral range without any second order contamination.
VIMOS@VLT has a similar FOV ($54\arcsec\times54\arcsec$) with respect to MUSE@VLT, but only using the low spatial and spectral resolution ($0.66\arcsec$ spx$^{-1}$ and R $\sim 250$ respectively) mode. 
This will significantly worsen the spatial information on the source and it will preclude the detailed analysis of the gas kinematics.
Moreover,  observations with a two set-ups will be necessary to cover the whole spectral range needed.}
